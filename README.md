## Final Project Description

**4/03/18**
Changed the scope of the project to be an artist profile for an artist I've been producing for. I initially was going to incorporate a database to host the metadata, but quickly realized there wasn't much I really wanted to display and it ended up being easier to just use the iTunes Search API to get the metadata for me. The spectrum analyzers are incorporated through p5.js with an instance for each song. The controls are also displayed through the use of p5.js. Expect an update tomorrow when I implement more user functionality allowing the user to search for more information about the artist, using the iTunes Search API to get the data. I would've already implemented that today, but when trying to set myself up with a local server to host the audio files, everything that could've went wrong did and it led me on what seemed like a never-ending google search to troubleshoot error after error. Figuring out how to set up two separate instances of p5 took a bit more time than I would've liked as well.
